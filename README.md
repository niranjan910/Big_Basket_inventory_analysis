## Project Background

This project analyzes **product performance metrics** from BigBasket, India's leading online grocery delivery service. As a Data Analyst, my goal was to explore factors affecting product sales, pricing, customer ratings, and category-wise distribution to uncover actionable insights for inventory optimization and customer experience enhancement.

BigBasket (Supermarket Grocery Supplies Pvt. Ltd.), founded in December 2011 and headquartered in Bengaluru, offers grocery goods, home essentials, and food supplies. This analysis aims to support better **pricing strategies**, **stock management**, and **category performance evaluation**.

- Customer ratings and reviews

Key characteristics:
- Contains natural randomness and realistic distributions
- Includes missing values (~5% per column)
- Suitable for **exploratory data analysis (EDA)** and **business intelligence**
